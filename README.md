An Android application using Java is useful for creating videos while products are being packed for shipment. This way, if something happens later, we have valid evidence.

It is already equipped with the date and time of packing, and a QR code tracking number that is scanned during packing.

It's very easy to use by scanning the QR code on the receipt paper, and the recording process begins. To stop the recording, scan the same QR code.

It also comes with a file compression feature using ffmpeg so that the file size is not too large, and it also includes the ability to upload to the server.
